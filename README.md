*RESEARCH AND REFLECTION*

The web applications I use the most is x(twitter), YouTube, Facebook and WhatsApp.
I find twitter well designed. This is because, the application has a great user interface and provides great user experience. It’s easily responsive on any size mobile screen size. I like its ability to bookmark tweets, so as to come and make reference to such tweets whenever it’s needed. When watching video, it’s has the ability to leave whatever playback you speed, till whenever you decide to increase or decrease it again. This is something a lot of other web applications lack. The twitter platform has also given me the opportunity to meet other people, who have the same interest as I do, which is tech. It’s a great platform for connecting.

I know how to use HTML and CSS Efficiently, but I find js a little complicated . So most of the project I’ve developed aren’t responsive, they basically just display information. So, by the end of the this cohort, I am hoping to learn JavaScript and typescript fully, so as to combine it with my knowledge of HTML( hypertext markup language) and CSS(cascading style sheet) be able to build scalable and fully responsive and functional websites and web applications.

The aspect of frontend I’m most excited about learning is JavaScript and react, and how they make websites responsive.
The part I’m nervous about is debugging.

*EXPLORATION EXERCISE *
When I explored the html structure, I noticed a lot of dibs. The classes were also very long. There were many script tags, which were nested.
